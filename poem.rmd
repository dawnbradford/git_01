“It is true  
I was created in you.  
It is also true  
That you were created for me.  
I owned your voice.  
It was shaped and tuned to soothe me.  
Your arms were molded  
Into a cradle to hold me, to rock me.  
The scent of your body was the air  
Perfumed for me to breathe.  
Mother,  
During those early, dearest days  
I did not dream that you had  
A large life which included me,  
For I had a life  
Which was only you.
